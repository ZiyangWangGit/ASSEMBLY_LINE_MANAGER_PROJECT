# C++ Project:Assembly Line Manager

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of an assembly line manager system, designed to manage the flow of customer orders through a series of workstations in an assembly line.

## Files
- **ms3.cpp**: Main program file containing the `main` function to run the assembly line manager system.
- **CustomerOrder.cpp/h**: Implements the `CustomerOrder` class for managing customer orders.
- **LineManager.cpp/h**: Implements the `LineManager` class for managing the assembly line flow.
- **Station.cpp/h**: Implements the `Station` class representing workstations in the assembly line.
- **Utilities.cpp/h**: Implements utility functions for parsing input and formatting output.
- **Workstation.cpp/h**: Implements the `Workstation` class representing workstations with orders.

## Usage
1. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable with four command-line arguments representing input files for stations, customer orders, line configuration, and output file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts and review the generated output to monitor the assembly line process.

## Features
- **Station Management**: Manages the status and flow of items through workstations.
- **Customer Order Processing**: Processes customer orders through the assembly line.
- **Line Configuration**: Configures the assembly line flow based on input configuration files.
- **Order Filling**: Fills customer orders by moving them through workstations.
- **Status Monitoring**: Monitors the status of workstations and customer orders during processing.

## Dependencies
- **Utilities.h**: Contains utility functions for parsing input and formatting output.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute the compiled executable.

## Credits
Ziyang Wang: Implemented the project.
